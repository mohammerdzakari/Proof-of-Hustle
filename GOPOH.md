# 🧠 Proof-of-Hustle (POH)

> **Verifying Hustle. Empowering Talent. Decentralizing Opportunity.**  
> Proof-of-Hustle is a next-gen soulbound NFT protocol built to track, verify, and reward the grind of students, developers, and builders — with deep integration into the **Hedera** network and a mission to decentralize opportunity.

---

## 🌍 Why Proof-of-Hustle?

Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not.

Too many students — especially in Africa and underrepresented regions — are building, learning, and growing without recognition.  
POH bridges that gap by offering **onchain verification of effort**, rewarding grit, learning, and contribution with dynamic, soulbound NFTs that evolve as you grow.

> Whether you're pushing code on GitHub, finishing online courses, or winning bounties — POH records it, verifies it, and puts your **proof-of-hustle** onchain.

## 🔗 Built on Hedera — By Design

POH is proud to integrate with **Hedera Hashgraph** for its unmatched performance and public-good ethos:

- ✅ 10,000+ TPS — scalable enough for millions of students
- 💸 Micro-fees — ideal for high-volume NFT minting
- 🟢 Carbon-negative — a sustainable future for global builders
- 🧠 Smart contracts — enabling dynamic soulbound NFT logic
- 🛡️ Council governance — trusted, decentralized, and secure

Hedera isn’t just fast. It’s built for **real-world impact** — and so are we.
