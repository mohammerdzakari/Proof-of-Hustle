#  Proof-of-Hustle

**Proof-of-Hustle (POH)** is a soulbound NFT system designed to showcase and verify builder contributions across the Web3 ecosystem — on-chain, transparent, and immutable.

## What is POH?

Proof-of-Hustle is your **on-chain resume** — a dynamic, soulbound NFT that updates automatically as you complete:
- GitHub contributions
- Devpost hacks & bounties
- Courses, certifications
- Community involvement
- On-chain activity & ecosystem participation

## Key Features

- **Verifiable Proof**: Your contributions, achievements, and skills — recorded permanently on-chain.
- **Soulbound NFT**: Non-transferable. Tied to your address, representing _you_ only.
- **Auto-Updates**: Integrates with GitHub, APIs, and other public sources to keep your hustle up-to-date.
- **Web3 Native Identity**: Built for builders, learners, and community contributors in crypto and tech.
